# DICOM CNN
Scripts useful for doing deep learning on DICOM images. Used to differentiate between images with and without lung nodules for my semester project in machine learning.

## Note:
While you are welcome to borrow ideas and code from this repo, other models performed much better in the competition. If you are interested in DICOM image segmentation in general, you may want to read about [some of the winning entries in the 2017 Data Science Bowl](https://datasciencebowl.com/2017algorithms/)
